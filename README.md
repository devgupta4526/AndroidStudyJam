 Functionality & Concepts used : 
 Notes app has a simple and user friendky design and has a organised UI so anyone can use it and take notes can also segregate things using colours and can also add links and images
1)The app uses Kotlin language.
2)Navigaton library was used for switch between screens of the app .
3)RoomDatabase was used in the app to store data.
4)ConstraintLayout is used so that app can adjust according to screen size.

 Future Scope :
 In future we tend to make further progress by adding a handwritten notes function so it can recognise your handwritting .
